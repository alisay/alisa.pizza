        <h3>A brief history of the internet, World Wide Web, and personal computing</h3>

        <p>“The cultural origin of the internet is related to 60s counter-culture. The rediscovering of liminal experience is the appeal. For people who don’t have some sort of spiritual practice, technological change is the thing that comes closest to the experience of the unreal. It’s similar to the experience of getting a cell phone call for the first time. 'This is weird, this is magic.' There are are all kinds of spooky experiences. It’s not just newness, either—it’s an experience where the previous understanding of the universe is broken. You don’t get many experiences like that if you don’t do drugs or have some sort of meditative practice. You don’t play with social rules or create new social spaces. Magic changes the rules of the world in a way we don’t expect.” — Eleanor Saitta</p>

        <p>My personal website is <a href="https://alisa.pizza/">https://alisa.pizza</a>, which is hosted by a company called NearlyFreeSpeech.NET.</p>

        <img src="./Nature of the Web_files/nfsn-welcome.png">

        <p>With NearlyFreeSpeech.NET, you pay for your hosting on a daily basis, and then some fee is added depending on site usage.</p>

        <p>Using an IP lookup service (like <a href="https://ipinfo.info/">ipinfo.info</a>), I can determine where physically my site is hosted... </p>

        <p>I emailed NearlyFreeSpeech.NET asking about their exact physical whereabouts</p>
        <img src="./Nature of the Web_files/host-email.png">

        <p>Maybe their data centers look something like this...</p>

        <p>Using a URL (Universal Resource Locator) I'm requesting to display the files that I hosted on a computer in Boston/Pheonix onto my screen. (A computer that is always connected to the internet is called a <i>server</i> or a <i>host</i>.)</p>

        <p>Connected computers sending thousands of 1’s and 0’s are being transferred to display text, images, etc.</p>

        <p>In early patent drawings of the internet, people didn't know how to represent it—is the internet a blob, a brain, a cloud, an explosion? People think the internet is mysterious (sometimes using metaphors like "the cloud")...</p>

        <img src="./Nature of the Web_files/internet-shape-noah-veltman.jpg">

        <p>But the internet is really just a bunch of computers connected together. </p>

        <img src="./Nature of the Web_files/computers-connected.png">

        <img src="./Nature of the Web_files/network-diagrams.jpg">
        <p>The internet has no centre. This architectural decision gives the network its robustness. The engineers sought to build a “survivable communication network”… that is, they tried to design a communication network that easily handles individual failures. You could build highly reliable network out of unreliable components.</p>

        <img src="./Nature of the Web_files/highway.jpg">

        <p>So to truly understand what you're looking at, it's important to know a bit of history. The internet isn't ethereal—the internet is physical.</p>

        <img src="./Nature of the Web_files/19b.jpg">

        <p>In his book called Protocol, Alexander Galloway says:</p>
        <p>
            “While many have debated the origins of the Internet, it’s clear that in many ways it was built to withstand nuclear attack. The Net was designed as a solution to the vulnerability of the military’s centralized system of command and control during the late 1950’s and beyond. For, the argument goes, if there are no central command centers, then there can be no central targets and overall damage is reduced.”
        </p>
        <img src="./Nature of the Web_files/20.jpg">
        <p>Computers date back to World War II <br>Scientist would use multiple computers to solve equations for developing atomic bombs.</p>
        <img src="./Nature of the Web_files/21.jpg">
        <p>But this still wasn’t the internet as we know it. The origin of the internet took some principles from these computers in WWII and created the first network called: ARPA in 1960</p>
        <img src="./Nature of the Web_files/22.png">
        <img src="./Nature of the Web_files/23.jpg">
        <p>ARPANET by Lawrence G. Roberts — This was the first network of computers to communicate between different locations at a few universities in California.</p>
        <img src="./Nature of the Web_files/34.jpg">
        <img src="./Nature of the Web_files/35.jpg">
        <img src="./Nature of the Web_files/24.gif">

        <p>More computers were added quickly to the ARPANET during the following years, and work proceeded on completing a functionally complete Host-to-Host protocol and other network software.</p>
        <img src="./Nature of the Web_files/26.jpg">
        <img src="./Nature of the Web_files/27.jpg">
        <p>Transmission control protocol / Internet protocol was developed in the 1970 to allow different network systems to work together on one standardized system. We still use this protocol today.</p>
        <p>The computers were able to communicate with one another using a <i>packet switching mechanism.</i> </p>
        <img src="./Nature of the Web_files/25.png">
        <img src="./Nature of the Web_files/28.png">

        <img src="./Nature of the Web_files/packet-switching.gif">
        <p>Ray Tomlinson at BBN wrote the first basic email message send and read software, motivated by the need of the ARPANET developers for an easy coordination mechanism.</p>

        <img src="./Nature of the Web_files/33.jpg">
        <p>But looking for addresses for emails was quite tough. So the DNS // DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM was invented<br>A way to connect hosts yourname@whatever yourname@whatever.com / org / etc</p>

        <p>The first Macintosh was introduced on January 24, 1984, by Steve Jobs (see the lower photo) and it was the first commercially successful personal computer to feature two old known then, but still unpopular features—the mouse and the graphical
            user interface, rather than the command-line interface of its predecessors.</p>
        <img src="./Nature of the Web_files/43.jpg">
        <p>It was invented by Osborne Computers. The first portable computer was a success, with sales reaching 10,000 units a month. IBM launched the IBM 5155 Portable Personal Computer in 1984. In 1988, Compaq Computer launched the first laptop PC
            with VGA graphics, Compaq SLT/286.</p>
        <img src="./Nature of the Web_files/45.jpg">
        <p>The main use for the internet up until the 1990's was restricted communication between specific universities, companies, and government entities. There were no browsers or commercial use at this time. Mostly email and BBS (Bulletin Board Systems).</p>

        <p>ARPANET Had grown from 3 connections in 1960's to 20,000 connections on guarded networks but ARPANET couldn’t handle the traffic anymore NSFNET replaced arpanet in the 1992</p>

        <img src="./Nature of the Web_files/52.jpg">
        <p>New government legislation was passed to allowed commercial use of the network's communication systems and Compuserve / MCI mail sent the first commercial emails across the internet</p>

        <p>In 1989, Tim Berners‐Lee was working at CERN and produced an unassuming document with the title “Information Management: A Proposal”. His supervisor recognized the potential of the idea…</p>

        <img src="./Nature of the Web_files/berners-lee.png">

        <p>That proposal would become the World Wide Web in the early 90's. Note that the Web and the internet are different things. Tim Berners Lee is said to be the inventer of the WWW -- using hypertext to link pages.</p>
